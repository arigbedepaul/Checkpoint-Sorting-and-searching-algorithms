Let's go through the code together - step by step:

FOR i FROM 1 TO arr.length - 1 DO:

This line initiates a loop that goes through each element of the array starting from the second element (index 1) and going up to the last element. The loop variable i keeps track of the current card you're dealing with. key := arr[i];

note that the first comparison is done with the first element, index 0

Here, you pick one card (element) from the unsorted pile and call it the "key." The "key" is the card you're currently trying to place in its correct spot. j := i - 1;

You use another variable j to keep track of the position of the right-most card in the sorted pile. You'll start comparing the "key" with this right-most card in the sorted pile.

WHILE (j >= 0 AND arr[j] > key) DO:

The above WHILE line initiates a while loop that continues as long as two conditions are met: j is greater than or equal to 0 (meaning there are still cards in the sorted pile), and the card (element) at position j in the sorted pile is greater than the "key" card. You're essentially comparing cards to find the right spot for the "key."

arr[j + 1] := arr[j];

Inside the while loop, if the card at position j in the sorted pile is larger than the "key," you shift (move) that card to the right to make space for the "key." You use arr[j + 1] to represent the position where you'll move this card.

j := j - 1;

After shifting a card to the right, you decrease the j value by 1 to move to the next card in the sorted pile and continue comparing.

arr[j + 1] := key;

Once you find the correct spot for the "key" (where the "key" is smaller than the card at position j), you insert the "key" card into its correct position in the sorted pile. You place it at arr[j + 1], and it now becomes part of the sorted cards.

The process repeats for each card (element) in the array, and by the end of the loop, you'll have sorted all the cards in the array.

This algorithm mimics the process of sorting a deck of playing cards one card at a time, making space for each card and placing it in the right spot to achieve a fully sorted deck.
